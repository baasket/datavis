# datavis
A uni project for a data visualization course.

This is uploaded as a lightweight Unity Project. Inside the only scene, one 
should type their IMDB API key (one the DataFetcher instance). Such a key can
be acquired for free on http://www.omdbapi.com/.

It should also be noted that this app requires an AR marker to be used. Said
marker is included in this repo.

This project and this repo contain tools and resources that belong to Unity
Technologies and other third party corporations and people. Any use, commercial
or otherwise, of this project, should comply with their rules and guidelines.
